To-do:
- get amplitude scaling sorted - partly sorted with manual scaling - different scaling values retain original value
- Get channels working for high sampling frequencies (50ksa/ALT)
- Adjustable vertical offset available for both channels

Bugs:
- 50ms/div onwards (faster) don't work - checked against Windows version - same result
-
