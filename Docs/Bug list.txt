Done:
- get amplitude scaling sorted - partly sorted with manual scaling - different scaling values retain original value
- Adjustable vertical offset available for both channels - Done!


Bugs:
- 50ms/div onwards (faster) don't work - checked against Windows version - same result
- 

=======================================================================================

To-do:
- Get triggering working - 30 mins
- Get channels working for high sampling frequencies (50ksa/ALT) - 40 mins

Refreshed To-do list (1st March 2021):
- One major issue is how resource hungry the scope data grabbing + plotting is. If you remove all the scaling and series1/2 filling
and plotting you reduce the CPU workload to about 2/3thirds. This still leaves a lot to be desired on the HID scope data grabbing end.
Need to revise this, especially since we don't need to be updating our screens at 60fps (I mean it'd be nice but...).
 - Start looking at where the bottlenecks are in terms of data-grabbing and how long operations are taking on average! Break it down
 into smaller chunks and go from there.
