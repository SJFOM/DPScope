Done:
- get amplitude scaling sorted - partly sorted with manual scaling - different scaling values retain original value
- Adjustable vertical offset available for both channels - Done!


Bugs:
- 50ms/div onwards (faster) don't work - checked against Windows version - same result
- 

=======================================================================================

To-do:
- Get triggering working - 30 mins
- Get channels working for high sampling frequencies (50ksa/ALT) - 40 mins
